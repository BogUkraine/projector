Cannot extrapolate this data, as the noise is quite big. Random values and random find node value alongside random delete node make it unpredictable. It would be possible to predict something in case of bigger data samples, but then call stack is exceeded.

As for counting sort: it will not have any sense in case of huge boundaries of values. In case there are 5 values and the biggest one is 10^10 -> we will need to build an array of 10^10 size, which is quite unefficient.
